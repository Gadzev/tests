# Buttons
Your task is to make a button generator.

The application starts with a single numeric input and a "Make buttons" button.

When the button is clicked, you need to create as many buttons as set in the numeric input. All buttons must display it's order number within it, starting with 1. I.e. if the value of "4" is within the numeric input, you should create four buttons, labeled "Button 1", "Button 2", "Button 3" and "Button 4".

Each of the newly created button, when clicked, should output (to the result div) that it was, indeed cliked at the specified time, i.e. clicking on the third button should add to the end of the div's content the string: 

```
Button #3 was clicked on 03/04/2018, 13:22:17
```
