# General remarks

This test is for people who are applying for JavaScript based internship positions within Sourcico. The tests are not eliminatory, and not all tests must be done by each candidate, but still, more is better.

There are several independent tasks in separate folders. All of the examples need some changes in order to work as specified. The specification for every task is in the readme.md file within each folder.

In order to solve the problem, you'll need to fork this repository, make the necessary changes, and then make a pull request with the solution.

# Advices
Use any advanced features that you know - feel free to show off.  
Unless specified, do not use external libraries, like JQuery or underscore.  
Document any decisions you make. If you need to make an assumption, explain it.
